* eglot-jl

This is a simple package to make using [[https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl][Julia's language server]] easier
with [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]]. It can be installed from [[https://melpa.org/#/eglot-jl][melpa]] by [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][adding melpa to your
~package-archives~ ]] and doing =M-x package-install RET eglot-jl RET=
with Emacs 26.1+.

After installation, ~eglot-jl-init~ will load support for the Julia
language server into eglot and project.el. If ~eglot-jl-init~ has been
run in your emacs session, running ~eglot~ in a ~julia-mode~ buffer
will start a language server for the [[https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.1/manual/code-loading/#Project-environments-1][Julia project]] to which the buffer
belongs. The first time ~eglot~ is run, the Julia language server will
be downloaded and installed into the default depot (e.g. =~/.julia=)
in its own isolated project environment. This may take a long time, so
~eglot-connect-timeout~ should be increased for this first run.

** FAQ
*** Why am I receiving ~Error running timer: (error "[eglot] Timed out")~ messages?
The most likely reason is that [[https://github.com/julia-vscode/SymbolServer.jl/issues/56][SymbolServer.jl takes a very long time
to process project dependencies]]. This is a one-time process that
shouldn't cause issues once the dependencies are cached, however it
can take over a minute to process each dependency. By default, eglot
will only wait wait 30 seconds for a language server to be ready; this
is controlled by =eglot-connect-timeout=.

To work around this issue, you can:

1. Set =eglot-connect-timeout= to a very high value.
   - Progress of the SymbolServer can be monitored in the =*EGLOT
     (ProjectName/julia-mode) stderr*= buffer.
2. Run the following, from your project directory:

#+begin_src sh
  julia --project=path/to/eglot-jl/ path/to/eglot-jl/eglot-jl.jl
#+end_src

The SymbolServer is finished with caching dependencies when it
displays:

#+begin_quote
[ Info: Received new data from Julia Symbol Server.
#+end_quote


*** Can I speed-up server start-up times?

By default, starting a new language server (which is done once per project)
takes some time: around 20 seconds are needed before the server is ready, which
manifests itself by the =[eglot:projectName]= indicator showing up in the
modeline.

The =compile.jl= script that ships with =eglot-jl= allows compiling a system
image, which can greatly speed-up language server start-up times:

#+begin_src sh
  julia path/to/eglot-jl/compile.jl
#+end_src

This will take a few minutes to generate a system image in
=path/to/eglot-jl/eglot-jl.X.Y.Z.so= (where =X.Y.Z= is your julia version number,
and the file extension is adapted to your system: =.dylib= for MacOS, =.dll= for
Windows).

You can then instruct =eglot-jl= to use this system image by adding the
following to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq eglot-jl-julia-flags '("--sysimage=/path/to/eglot-jl/eglot-jl.X.Y.Z.so"))
#+end_src

This should reduce language server startup times to less than 2 seconds.

Be aware that you should update this system image (by running =compile.jl=
again) when julia changes, or if you update =eglot-jl= itself. If anything goes
wrong with this system image, you can always reset your julia flags to stop
using it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq eglot-jl-julia-flags nil)
#+end_src
